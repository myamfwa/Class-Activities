Hello Everyone! 

My name is Musonda, I am an adventurous person currently working in the credit union system.
I am interested in further enhancing my skills to be able to work on more collaborative-challenging tasts.
I choose FinTech because there is a lot of opportunity and growth within the sector that can take you anywhere. I am still deciding exactly where my newfound technical skills will take me ask I am more interested in the job responsibilities vs focussing on a specific sector.
