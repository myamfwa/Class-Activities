Hello Everyone! 

My name is Musonda, I am an adventourous person currently working in the credit union system.
I am interested in further enhancing my skills to be able to work on more collaborative-challenging tasts.
I choose FinTech because there is a lot of opportunity and growth within the sector that can take you anywhere. I am still deciding exactly where that will be.
